# R6S_Drone

Note:

Used a Raspberry-Pi 4B 
For some reason you have to run the program twice to get all the pwm/gpio stuff properly exported and configured
as of right now, there is on boot script for connecting to the hotspot(bookworm issues)
Uses WASD for movement

1. Clone the repository on your raspberry-pi and laptop(preferably)

2. Create a hotspot on your raspberry-pi
